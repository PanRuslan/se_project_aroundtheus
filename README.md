**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

**Description**

This is project for sharing photos from your trips with other people.
In the project were used such technologies as CSS Flex and CSS Grid for beautiful view and CSS Media queries for greater view on devices with all sizes and all shapes.

Good luck and have fun!
